# Note(elimisteve): This is just an example.  The keys/attribute
# names/property names contained in constants such as `TEMPERATURE`
# should only be included in this directory if said keys occur in
# published Executable Philosophy.  If you plan to use them in future
# publications, do not use them ahead of time; add them concurrently
# with publication.

# EXAMPLE
TEMPERATURE = (
    'temperature',  # TODO(elimisteve): Should 'temperature' be allowed? It's
                    # ambiguous, but will be useful to contextualists.
    'temp_f', 'temperature_f',
    'temp_c', 'temperature_c',
    'temp_k', 'temperature_k',
)
